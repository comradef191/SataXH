# SataXH
This is a simple breakout board that allows you to break-out the 12v & 5v rails of a SATA power connector to JSTXH connectors, allowing for easy integration of non-standard components into a PC such as an ESP-based RGB controller, which requires a 5v source but lacks a PC-compatible power input.

# NOTICE
As of 20JUl25 this board has not yet been tested, however should function.
If you wish to export your own Gerber files, please make sure to have [the Nasin Nanpa font](https://github.com/ETBCOR/nasin-nanpa) installed
